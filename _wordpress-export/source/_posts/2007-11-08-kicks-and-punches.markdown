Baby T is being very active at the moment. As I sit here on the bed he is kicking quite a bit! I first felt his movements about three weeks ago. Every now and then I would feel just the slightest tap on the inside of my stomach. His movements are getting stronger and more noticable now. In fact tonight I put Kirby's hand on my stomach and he felt the baby move for the first time! Feeling Baby's T's kicks and punches is something I just don't get tired of. Who knows, maybe when he can kick hard enough to hurt me I might mind it a bit. For now though, one of my favorite things to do is sit and enjoy the movements of our little Baby T!
