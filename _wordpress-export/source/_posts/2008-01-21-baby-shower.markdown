I went home to Bryn Athyn this weekend for my second baby shower!Â  My sisters and mom had a very nice shower for me.Â  It was a great time and it was so fun to see everyone there.Â  I got some GREAT gifts and I am very thankful for them.Â  Hopefully we will have some pictures posted soon.Â  Thank you to my family and to all who came to the shower.Â  It was a wonderful afternoon!
