The work was anything but easy and fast. But the end result made all the effort worthwhile. Baby T's room went through the most transformation of any room in the new house. As you can see from the first picture the room not only had wallpaper but painted paneling as well. The second pictures shows the mess I dealt with after removing the layers of wallpaper and paneling. And the third picture shows the now finished room.

And I'm sure a tear or two fell from Mama T's eyes when she thought about the current condition of what we were calling the "disaster room". But the some help from my brother progress was finally made on the room. And last night I finished the last bit of work needed to call the room complete. Needless to say, Mama T and I am very excited about the end result of the room. It looks amazing.
