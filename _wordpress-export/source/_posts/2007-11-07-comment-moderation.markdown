I realized today some readers have posted comments to previous blog entries.Â  To avoid unwanted blog spam, comments are moderated.Â  So what does this mean?

Your first comment will be placed in a queue.Â  Melanie or I will approve the message.Â  Once approved your comment will display on the web site.Â  All future comments you make will not require approval.Â  It's only the first comment that has to be approved.

Melanie and I will make best effort to approve first time comments as quickly as possible, but given our travel schedules there might be times when it takes a day or two before the first time comment is approved.Â  If you like post a comment to this blog entry asking for approval and you can avoid the entire process when you are ready to post a real comment.
