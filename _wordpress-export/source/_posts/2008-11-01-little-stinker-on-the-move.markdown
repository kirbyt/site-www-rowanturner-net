Rowan was a hit in the Salem Commons. So many people were taking pictures of our little stinker. And why wouldn't they? He's do darn cute especially when he walks in his skunk costume.  
  


  
  


PS: We're not sure who from the Lanier clan gave us the skunk costume but thanks! It fit perfectly and was a huge hit.
