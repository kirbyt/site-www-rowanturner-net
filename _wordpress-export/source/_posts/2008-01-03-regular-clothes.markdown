Today I am packing up my clothes in preparation for our move.Â  Something that surprises me is how much I miss wearing my "regular" clothes...especially the sweaters.Â  At this time last year I would have told you that I was already sick of wearing the same old things.Â  This year my wardrobe is much smaller since I am limited to maternity clothes and I would just love toÂ wear some of my favorite sweaters!Â  Something else that surprises me is the size of my regular clothing.Â Â Everything looks so small!Â  I can't believe I could fit my tummy into those tops!Â  Of course having to wear maternity clothes for one season is not a big deal especially since the end result is going to be our little baby boy!Â  All of the clothes will be waiting for me next year...and the year after that.
