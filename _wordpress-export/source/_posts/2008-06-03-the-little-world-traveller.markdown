Rowan's second trip is off to a great start. He seems to really enjoy travel by plane. He slept during most of the flight to Nice, woke up from time to time to "play" and visit with other passengers, and of course to eat. Lucky for us and for those passengers around us, Rowan didn't cry the entire 7 hour flight.

After arriving to Nice we walked around Old Town while we waited for our hotel room. Rowan continued to sleep. Now we're in the hotel room. Mama T and I would like to join Rowan in a little shuteye but it seems Rowan is now ready to play. And of course eat. So we have to wait a bit before we nap. All good though. We want Rowan to adjust to the time zone difference as quickly as possible.
