Today is the end of an era for Rowan. He had the last of mommy milk.Â  Mama T stopped nursing him a couple of weeks ago, which is major in its own right, but we still had plenty a milk stored in the freezer. Since Rowan stopped drinking from a bottle long ago we have been using the stored milk in the mornings to make his cereal. Today I used the last of the mommy milk to make his cereal ending a nearly 14 month daily routine of having mommy milk from either the tap or packaged.
