I posted a short video of Rowan's first Christmas. Not only is it his first Christmas, but it was our first Christmas in the new house. 

As a side note, the video hosted on YouTube isn't doing my new Flip Mino HD justice. I'll look at posting a HD version of the video soon so I can show off the resolution of the Mino.
