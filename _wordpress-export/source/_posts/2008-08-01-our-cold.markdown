Rowan has been a bit sick this week.Â  I think it was on Tuesday that we realized he wasn't feeling quite right.Â  His nose was running and he didn't want to do much besides snuggling on my chest.Â Â  We took his temperature and it was just overÂ  100 degrees.Â Â Â  I guess we kind of knew something was up when he couldn't sleep more than about 30-45 minutes without waking up crying...two nights in a row.Â  We learned first hand that a baby's sleep schedule really does get interrupted when he is sick.Â  All three of us got much less sleep than we were used too...the only thing that seemed to work for at least a few hours at a time was having Rowan sleep in bed right between Kirby and I.Â  Fortunately Rowan's cold, or whatever he had, seems to have been short lived.Â  Now I am the one who is suffering a bit from it.Â  I really just have a stuffy nose and head.Â  But I keep thinking of our little boy who was feeling like this or probably worse than this for the past few days.Â  He is so small and I am sure he had no idea what was going on.Â  He just knew he did not feel right.Â  Its a helpless feeling when your little one is sick.Â  I guess its inevitable...kids get sick... I just wish there was some way to keep Rowan from feeling bad.
