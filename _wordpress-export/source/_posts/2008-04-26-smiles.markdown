This afernoon Rowan and I spent some extra special time together.Â  I say this not only because he seemed so happy but because he just couldn't stop smiling at me!Â  While I talked to him he watched me and looked me in the eyes.Â  Moments later he was smiling and smiling!Â  He even gave me a few coos.Â  The brightness in hisÂ face gave me so much joy!Â  Each and every day Rowan does something new to bring a smile to my face.Â  I feel so happy to see that I am starting to do the same for him!
