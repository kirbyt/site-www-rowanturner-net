I've been warned about Baby T's first poopie pants and I'm not looking forward to it.Â  Clean up [meconium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meconium) doesn't sound like fun.Â  But this short article on the [color of poopie](http://www.babycenter.com/400_whats-the-normal-color-of-a-breastfed-babys-bowel-movement_505546_1000.bc) makes it sound not as bad.
