I am a little late in writing this but not too late to wish Rowan a happy 1st birthday!  We had a birthday party here in our little house in Salem.  It was wonderful to have so many friends and family to help us celebrate the occasion.

Wow, I am the mother of a one year old!  I am pretty sure that he is the cutest one year old there ever was :)  This past year was an amazing one.  Seeing him reach the major milestones such as rolling over, crawling and walking were great.  But it was the small things too that had me looking forward to each and every day with Rowan.  Watching him "talk" to Mr. Penguin, discovering how much he liked to eat, teaching him how to wave "bye bye," watching him dance, and listening to him babble sound after sound are just a few of the activities that  had me enternained all year long.  I loved the first year but I have to admit, I can't wait to see what comes next!

Happy Birthday Rowan!
