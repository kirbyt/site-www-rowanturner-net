As I write this Kirby is hard at work in Baby T's room.Â  He has finished painting the ceiling and has just started painting the walls blue!Â  Of course its too early to tell exactly how it will look but so far so good!Â  I am so excited about getting his room ready.Â  OnceÂ the room isÂ painted we will go out shopping for furniture and get all of his stuff unpacked.Â  Very exciting!
