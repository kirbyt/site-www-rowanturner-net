This might sound a littleÂ silly but Kirby is my hero.Â  He has been working SO hard on our new house.Â  I have been trying to help butÂ being six months pregnant limits theÂ jobs I can do.Â  Plus I get tired so easily!Â  Removing wallpaper, prepping the walls and painting them is a huge job.Â  Kirby isÂ completely dedicatedÂ to this job and I appreciate it more than he knows.Â  Without all of his hard work....well I just don't want to think about where we would be.Â  Thank you Kirby...you're my hero!
