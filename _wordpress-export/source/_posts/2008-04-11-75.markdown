Wow, almost two weeks have gone by since Rowan was born and I haven't written a single thing.Â  Of course I have a lot less time to spend on the computer these days.Â  It is hard to type while breastfeeding I must admit.Â  I thinkÂ the biggest reason I have not written though is that I just don't know where to start!Â  How do I put all of the feelings and emotions of the past two weeks in to words?Â  Rowan's birth was such an amazing event and the happiness that I feel because of it brings tears to my eyes.Â  Every time I look at him I just can't believe that he came from inside of me...and that Kirby and IÂ made him.Â  We waited so long to hold him and see what he would look like.Â  Being pregnant isn't that fun but I can't believe how quickly I have forgotten about all the aches and pains it brought.Â  All I think about now is how much I love Rowan and how amazing it is that he is now in our lives.
