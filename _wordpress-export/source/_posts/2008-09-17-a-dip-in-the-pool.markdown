For starters the water was something like 85 degrees. Still, Rowan loved the swim. So much so that he dipped underwater for the first time. Here are more pictures of [Rowan swimming](http://thecave.smugmug.com/gallery/5994012_RUoRm/1/374535851_HYaU3) that day.

  
For those wondering, that is Rowan's cousin Lucas swimming with us.
