This week has been a week of new skills for Rowan. Earlier in the week he learned to [locked and unlock the front door](http://www.rowanturner.net/?p=207), which I discovered after he locked me out of the house. And yesterday he learned how to "pull the trigger." Yes, Rowan has discovered the joys of sticking his finger down his throat and throwing up.

It all started about a week ago. Rowan was sticking his finger, well, actually it's more like his whole hand, down his throat. He laughed each time he did it. Apparently the gagging reflects is funny to him. He stopped doing it for a few days but started again yesterday. Now I wasn't there to see it happen, but the story goes something like this.

Rowan and Melanie were outside playing in the water. Rowan started sticking his hand into his mouth and shoving his finger further and further back. He laughed each time he did it. Melanie asked him to stop and warned that if he continued he might throw up. But the kid found it too funny to stop.

Rowan was wet from playing in the water so Melanie brought him into the house to change his clothes. She stripped the kid down to his diaper. Meanwhile he continued sticking his hand in his month and laughing.

All of a sudden Rowan had an odd look on his face. It was the kind of look one makes when tasting something awful. Melanie noticed Rowan's belly was covered in vomit, and the kid wasn't laughing any more. Melanie asked, "Rowan, you going to do that again?" He reply, "Nuh-uh."
