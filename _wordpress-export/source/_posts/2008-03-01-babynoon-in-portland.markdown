[![](http://thecave.smugmug.com/photos/260500634_vcc4y-Th.jpg)](http://thecave.smugmug.com/gallery/4433186_MQWid)Mama T and I finally got away for a 2-day [babymoon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babymoon) in Portland Maine. Portland is such a neat town and we had a lot of fun. We also ate one of the best dinners either of us has had in a very long time. The restaurant is called [555 (five fifty-five)](http://www.fivefifty-five.com/) and we both highly recommend it.
