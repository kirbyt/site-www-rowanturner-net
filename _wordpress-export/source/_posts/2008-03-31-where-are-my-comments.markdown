There are a lot of new readers to the Rowan T blog so I thought it appropriate to remind everyone of the [comment moderation](http://www.rowanturner.net/babyt/?p=16).Â  To reduce unwanted spam messages to this blog site we have enabled comment moderation.Â  This means the first time you post a comment, the comment must be approved by either Mama T or Papa T before it is displayed.Â  Once it has been approved it will be displayed.Â  No additional moderation is needed once your comment has been approved.Â  In other words, all other comments you post will automatically display after we approve your first comment.

We'll do our best to approve all new comments as quickly as possible, but some times it might take us a couple of extra days.Â  If you like, post a comment to this blog entry asking for approval.Â  We'll approve it and you will avoid the process in the future when you are ready to post a real comment.
