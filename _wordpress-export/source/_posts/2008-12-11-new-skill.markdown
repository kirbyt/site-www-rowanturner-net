Rowan has a new skill. He likes to push things around the house so he can "walk" by himself. Problem is, when he gets stuck on a wall or something he can't figure out how to make the chair, or whatever, move again so he cries.Â  And boy does he get angry when he can't move it own his own. As Mama T said, "This new skill is both a blessing and curse at the same time." Enjoy the video.
