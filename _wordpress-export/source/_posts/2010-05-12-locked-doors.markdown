Rowan learned a new skill today, how to lock and fortunately unlock the front door. Mornings when I take Rowan to school I setup the stroller outside. Rowan typically stands in the doorway watching me. Today he did something a different.

Today Rowan closed the front door. "How cute," I thought. But to my surprise not only had he closed the door but he locked it too. He had locked me out of the house. 

I quickly thought about my options. Run to a neighbor's house and get our spare key? Try to break in through a window? As I thought through the options I knocked on the door and said, "Rowan, will you unlock the door please?" I could heard him giggling on the other side.

A minute and a few giggles later Rowan unlocked the door. I quickly opened it to find him standing there with a really big grin on his face.

I learned a valuable lesson this morning. Always keep my house keys on me even if I'm stepping out for only a minute.
