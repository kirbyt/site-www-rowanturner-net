Today is Rowan's first day at school. "School" is what we are calling daycare. He started off the day sleeping in. Yep, first day of school and the kid decides to sleep late. Still, we made it to school on time despite sleeping late and me having to push the stroller with the kid in it through snow covered side walks. "We walked 3 miles, up hill, in knee deep snow, to and from school every day." Haha, that's how I felt this morning.

Rowan immediately recognized the daycare, a good thing. The previous visits were paying off. We went to his classroom and he did his little "I'm shy" thing. I put away his coat and other stuff, kissed him goodbye, then walked out. He was interested in what the other kids were doing, another good thing, so I don't think he really realized I was leaving.

I'm not sure how he is doing right now, but the daycare hasn't called to say "Come get your boy!" I take this as a good sign. Per the wife's request, who is out of the country today, I will call the daycare this afternoon to check on the kid. Then I'll walk back to pick him up at the end of the day. But until then I'm going to enjoy having a quiet house all to myself.
