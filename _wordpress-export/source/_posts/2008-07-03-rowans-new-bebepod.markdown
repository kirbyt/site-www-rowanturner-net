I never heard of a BebePod so I did a quick search and decided right away that Rowan should have one. It just seems like something Rowan would like especially since he likes to sit up.Â  And sure enough, Rowan does like [his new BebePod](http://thecave.smugmug.com/gallery/5317007_uPLaU/1/324661858_P37w6).
