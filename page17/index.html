You want to see more pictures of Rowan. I want to post more pictures of Rowan. But honestly I don’t have a lot of free time. Heck, I should be in bed right now sleeping instead of sitting behind the keyboard.</p>

            Tummy Time
        </h2>
        
        <p>Rowan has discovered that rolling onto his stomach is something he would like to get used to doing.Â  Yesterday Rowan rolled from his back to tummy for the first time while playing with his toys.Â  It was very exciting to watch!Â  I couldn’t get him to repeat the act however last night as he was trying to sleep, rolling over seemed to be first on his mind.Â  Between 10:00 and 11:00 Rowan woke up 5 or 6 times and each time that I checked on him he was trying his hardest to roll over to his tummy.Â  I think the great effort was waking him up.Â  We finally got him settled on his back and he slept ‘till about 4:00am.Â  At that point Kirby got up and rocked him for a while and then put him back in his crib.Â  The next thing I knew, I rolled over in bed and saw that the clock said 7:18am!Â  Rowan was still asleep?Â  No way!Â  So I went to check on him and there he was in his crib, sound asleep on his tummy!Â  He slept ‘till after 8:00!!!! I know that babies shouldn’t be put to sleep on their stomachs…that is why we put him down on his back.Â  But hey, if he is going to roll over himself and possibly sleep better, I am all for it.Â  I’m proud of Rowan and his newly learned skill!</p>

            First Time Typing
        </h2>
        
        <p>Rowan typed on the keyboard for the very first time today. A few weeks ago I put his hand on the keyboard but he immediately pulled away. But this morning he was very interested in the keyboard. He was reaching for it so I decided to see what he would do. Â I opened a text editor and he punched out the following (<a href="http://twitter.com/rowan_t/statuses/884167056">click here to see</a>).</p>

            Our Cold
        </h2>
        
        <p>Rowan has been a bit sick this week.Â  I think it was on Tuesday that we realized he wasn’t feeling quite right.Â  His nose was running and he didn’t want to do much besides snuggling on my chest.Â Â  We took his temperature and it was just overÂ  100 degrees.Â Â Â  I guess we kind of knew something was up when he couldn’t sleep more than about 30-45 minutes without waking up crying…two nights in a row.Â  We learned first hand that a baby’s sleep schedule really does get interrupted when he is sick.Â  All three of us got much less sleep than we were used too…the only thing that seemed to work for at least a few hours at a time was having Rowan sleep in bed right between Kirby and I.Â  Fortunately Rowan’s cold, or whatever he had, seems to have been short lived.Â  Now I am the one who is suffering a bit from it.Â  I really just have a stuffy nose and head.Â  But I keep thinking of our little boy who was feeling like this or probably worse than this for the past few days.Â  He is so small and I am sure he had no idea what was going on.Â  He just knew he did not feel right.Â  Its a helpless feeling when your little one is sick.Â  I guess its inevitable…kids get sick… I just wish there was some way to keep Rowan from feeling bad.</p>
