            The Little Traveler
        </h2>
        
        <p>Rowan had a wonderful time this weekend visiting with family down in P.A.Â  While Kirby flew to Memphis to go camping with his dad, brother and nephew, Rowan and I flew down to Philly to attend my sister Laura’s bridal shower and bachelorette party.Â  Once again he did wonderfully on the flights.Â  He just loves to sleep on airplanes!Â  The weekend was great.Â  Although I got a little less sleep since Kirby wasn’t with me to help with night duty, I got tons of help during the day.Â  Rowan was non stop smiles all weekend and everyone couldn’t get enough of him!Â  Rowan did come with me to the shower, he slept right through it, but he did not come to the bachelorette party.Â  He stayed home with Grandma, Grandad and Aunt Judy.Â  They said he didn’t cry a bit!Â  Rowan also took his first dip in a pool.Â  The water was a bit chilly so he wasn’t too crazy about it but he didn’t seem to mind it much either.Â  Hopefully the next time we can find some warmer water and he can really enjoy it.</p>

            Le Bebe is Back from France

        <p><a href="http://thecave.smugmug.com/gallery/5154049_Ehpci/1/311929379_wt2Jp"><img src="http://thecave.smugmug.com/photos/311929379_wt2Jp-Th.jpg" alt="" /></a>As most may know, we are back from France! We had such an amazing time connecting with old friends and just hanging out in the wonderful town of Aix-en-Provence! I could go on and on about the trip but I am sure that most people want to hear about Rowan. How did he do on the trip? The answer is that he did great! It turns out that he loves to fly so much that it just puts him to sleep! That made it very easy for us. All of our flights went smoothly and Rowan had his own seat, right between Kirby and I, so we all had plenty of space. The only downside is that as an employee we are not allowed to travel in business class with a child under the age of 8. We have become spoiled I admit. But the crews took good care of us and the flights were not full.</p>

            Live Internet TV Broadcast Featuring Rowan
        </h2>
        
        <p>Rowan and I did a live Internet TV broadcast today. It wasn’t exciting but 2 viewers did tune in to see Rowan. One viewer was Mama T and the other my friend Alex. Rowan and I might do this again in the near future. For those of you who missed it, here is the video replay.  </p>
