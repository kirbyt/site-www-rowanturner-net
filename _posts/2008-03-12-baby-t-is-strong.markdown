It has been a while since I have written anything.Â  Maybe I have been too distracted by Baby T's kicks.Â  Wow is he strong!Â  I didn't realize that his kicks would at times actually hurt me!Â  Its not that bad really, but sometimes he kicks so many times in the same spot that I can't believe a bruise doesn't appear :)Â  An active baby means a healthy baby so I am happy to take his abuse.Â  Its kind of strange to know that in a few more weeks I won't be feeling the constant movement in there.Â  Instead we will have a real, live baby!Â  Just 16 days 'till my due date....it can't come fast enough.
