Today was a big day for Rowan.Â  First he went with his mom down to Boston and had lunch on Newbury St. with Aunt Brooke.Â  After returning home he had some "tummy time" and he rolled over twice!Â  Back in June he did roll once from tummy to back by accident I think.Â  This time however he seemed to know what he was doing.Â  It was a struggle but he managed to roll over twice before becoming to exhausted to do it again:)Â  Congratulations Rowan!
