The other day I setup Baby T's new highchair and stroller, and later this week I plan to stop by the police station to have a safety inspector install the base for the infant car seat.Â  Also, the new furniture is scheduled to arrive on Wednesday.Â  We can't wait to the crib up and put away Baby T's clothes in his new dresser slash changing table.
