Rowan had his second checkup with the pediatrician today.Â  He is up to a whooping 8 pounds 1 ounce, up from 7 pounds even at his last checkup.Â  The doctor was pleasantly surprised by his rapid growth, and said it was outstanding.Â  I thought he should be a bit heavier but that just shows what I know, or rather don't know, about the growth rate of a new born.
