title: "Why do I drop everything?"

I wish I could say that everything I touch turns to gold. Instead it seems that everything I touch falls to the floor. Do pregnant women drop things more easily or am I just noticing it more because I am pregnant and its not as easy to bend down to pick up the dropped items? Sometime it seems that all I need to do is look at something and it falls to the floor.
