I want to post more pictures of Rowan. But honestly I don't have a lot of free time. Heck, I should be in bed right now sleeping instead of sitting behind the keyboard.

The [first set](http://thecave.smugmug.com/gallery/5848155_4pVqU/1/362920175_FfVkA) contains selected Rowan pictures from our trip to Lake Champlain with the Davis Clan. The [second set](http://thecave.smugmug.com/gallery/5848210_rFGcV/1/362929835_mvqJC) contains selected Rowan pictures from our trip to Memphis / Olive Branch to visit the Lanier and Turner Clans along with a special visit with a Bailey.
