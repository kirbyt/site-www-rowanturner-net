This isn't really an entry about Baby T.Â  However IÂ we areÂ missing a big day in NYC because of him :)Â  Kirby and I spend every St. Patrick's Day in New York and have a great time with the Early family.Â  We go to the parade... to parties and bars...its so much fun.Â  Since we are 11 days away from my due date we decided we would have to pass onÂ  Paddy's Day in NYC this year.Â  Just know that next year we will be there for Baby T's first St. Patrick's Day...we can't wait!
