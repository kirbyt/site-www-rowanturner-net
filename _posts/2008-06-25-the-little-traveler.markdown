Rowan had a wonderful time this weekend visiting with family down in P.A.Â  While Kirby flew to Memphis to go camping with his dad, brother and nephew, Rowan and I flew down to Philly to attend my sister Laura's bridal shower and bachelorette party.Â  Once again he did wonderfully on the flights.Â  He just loves to sleep on airplanes!Â  The weekend was great.Â  Although I got a little less sleep since Kirby wasn't with me to help with night duty, I got tons of help during the day.Â  Rowan was non stop smiles all weekend and everyone couldn't get enough of him!Â  Rowan did come with me to the shower, he slept right through it, but he did not come to the bachelorette party.Â  He stayed home with Grandma, Grandad and Aunt Judy.Â  They said he didn't cry a bit!Â  Rowan also took his first dip in a pool.Â  The water was a bit chilly so he wasn't too crazy about it but he didn't seem to mind it much either.Â  Hopefully the next time we can find some warmer water and he can really enjoy it.

This coming weekend we are off traveling again although not on an airplane.Â  We are headed up to Loudon, NH to see Grandad and Uncle Dave at a big NASCAR event.Â  We will be camping in an R.V.Â  and going to a few of the races.Â  Don't worry, we won't be taking Rowan to any of them...its way too loud.Â  Maybe next year.
