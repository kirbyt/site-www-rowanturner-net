Rowan has been keeping busy since leaving the hospital.Â  He likes to sleep, eat, pee and poop.Â  And boy can he poop.Â  During our hospital stay Rowan went through 2 outfits, but the during the last 24 hours at home he has gone through...well, I've lost count but it was enough to make a load for the washer.

Speaking of pee, little Rowan seems like peeing...especially on Mama T.Â  So far I have been spared from his target practice, but Mama T hasn't been so lucky.

I wonder what excitement Rowan will have tomorrow?
