Today was Rowan's first day skiing. He was very excited when we arrived at the ski shop to rent a pair of skis for him. The sales person handed us the smallest pair they had. Rowan had to immediately carry them around, but when it was time to try on boots, he wasn't happy.

I'm not a skier so I don't know first hand, but ski boots look uncomfortable. And judging from Rowan's reactions he was not comfortable wearing the ski boots. Still, we decided we were going to do this so we didn't let his new lack of interest stop us.

"Rowan, you want to go skiing?" I asked. "No, no." said Rowan.

We arrived at the slopes. We let him watch others for a while then Melanie put on her skis to show Rowan how it's done. He was finally interested again. A few minutes later he wanted to give it a try.

We put on his boot, but he still didn't like them saying, "No! No!" So we loosened the boots a bit and he was finally happy. Next I snapped him onto the skis and off he went...with a little help of course.

He enjoying going fast the most, laughing as I ran with him while holding his hands. He also enjoyed watching the other skiers and snowboarders around him. He lasted nearly 30 minutes on the skis which really surprised me. I honestly didn't think we would get him on the skis the first day.

We're keeping the skis overnight and plan to take him out again tomorrow. Hopefully he will enjoy it even more on day two.

By the way, the "No, no" you hear in the background during one of the videos is not Rowan. It's a little girl about Rowan's age who was done for the day.
