The other day I mentioned we learned that [Baby T is a boy](http://www.melanieandkirby.com/babyt/?p=11).Â  The doctor gave us the standard disclaimer that the gender is determined based on a visual inspection of the ultrasound images and there is the slight chance of a mis-read.Â  But I have since learned that a mis-read rarely if ever occurs when the gender is determined to be a boy.Â  In other words, some times the doctor will say "You're having a girl" when in fact the baby is a boy.Â  But rarely if ever does the reverse happen.

Best I can tell this has to do with identifying the [scrotum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum) in the ultrasound images.Â  The doctor cannot find the scrotum and assumes the baby's gender is a girl.Â  But surprise you have a baby boy.
