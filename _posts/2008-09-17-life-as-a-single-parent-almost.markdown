Mama T has been back at work for a few weeks now and Rowan and I have adjusted nicely.  Still, being a single parent even for 2 and 1/2 days a week is not without it challenges.  But the good news is each week gets better and better.

Still, challenges aside, the kid does great when Mama T is traveling.  And while I do get stressed at times it still nothing compared to other single parents. Heck, just look at [this picture](http://photos.thecave.com/gallery/5754720_woac7/1/355728620_5jmnf) of my mom (Rowan's GranMom) feeding not only me, but my brother who is only 11 months younger and herself.  Now that take skills.  I can't even imagine.
