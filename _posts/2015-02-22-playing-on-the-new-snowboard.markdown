Rowan has outgrown his snowboard, so we picked up a new one for him today. Thankfully he has a seasonal rental, so it doesn't cost us anything to swap out boards.

He strapped on the new board the moment we got home, and hasn't taken it off yet (other than to eat dinner). Here he is showing off tail presses with the new board on the carpet.
