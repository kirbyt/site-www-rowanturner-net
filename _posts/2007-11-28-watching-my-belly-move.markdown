Tonight as I was resting my hand on my belly I could feel Baby T moving.Â  His kicks felt fairly strong so I pulled my hand away and just watched.Â Â A few moments later I saw my belly move!Â  This was a first for me and it put a big smile on my face.Â  For the past fifteen mintutesÂ I've just been sitting here watching my belly as Baby T kicks.Â  I wish Kirby was here to see it!
