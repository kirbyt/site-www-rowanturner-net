We had such an amazing time connecting with old friends and just hanging out in the wonderful town of Aix-en-Provence! I could go on and on about the trip but I am sure that most people want to hear about Rowan. How did he do on the trip? The answer is that he did great! It turns out that he loves to fly so much that it just puts him to sleep! That made it very easy for us. All of our flights went smoothly and Rowan had his own seat, right between Kirby and I, so we all had plenty of space. The only downside is that as an employee we are not allowed to travel in business class with a child under the age of 8. We have become spoiled I admit. But the crews took good care of us and the flights were not full.

Once in France, we had just a little trouble going to sleep the first night. We were exhausted but he thought staying up to 3:30am was a good idea. This makes sense since 3:30am means it was 9:30pm in the states. Each night he did better though despite all the activities we had planned. He tried his hardest to adjust and we definitely did not make it easy for him by keeping him out 'till 11:00 or 12:00 each night. Rowan is an easy going baby though and I think he really enjoyed being in France :) He even had his first taste of wine, which wasn't given to him by me or Kirby.

Now we have been home for six days and Rowan is just about back on schedule as far as sleeping more at night than during the day. Actually, Rowan just loves to sleep day and night. He is still a very happy baby, smiling all the time. I am sure he has already forgotten about his trip to France but his Mom and Dad have not. We had such a great time. Although traveling with a baby has its challenges here and there we would do it all over again. Anyone want to pay for us to go back?
