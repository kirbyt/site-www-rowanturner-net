People keep asking me, "Who does Rowan look like?Â  You or Kirby?"Â  My usual answer is that I do not know.Â  I really cannot tell which one of us he resembles.Â  However last night my opinion started to change a bit.Â  Kirby, who was just trying to be funny, started making "Rowan faces."Â  He crinkled up his face and stuck out his tongue whileÂ staring up at the celing fan whichÂ is something that Rowan does quite often.Â  In that moment I saw the resemblance between Kirby and Rowan.Â  It wasn't just that Kirby did a perfect job at imitating Rowan, it was that suddenly I could see how much Kirby and Rowan looked alike!Â Â It made me laugh out loud.Â Â In fact it made me laugh really hard.Â  I am looking forward to many more moments like this one!
