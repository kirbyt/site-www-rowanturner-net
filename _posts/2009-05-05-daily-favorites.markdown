When Rowan was born I set out to take at least 1 picture of him each and every day. Unfortunately I didn't see him every day so with the help of my wife, we attempted this crazy goal.

Believe it or not, we only missed 3 days. Well technically we missed 4 days but a friend took a picture of Rowan on one of those days. This means from the night he was born through his first birthday there were only 3 days that the little guy didn't get his picture take.

So here it is. My [daily favorites](http://photos.thecave.com/gallery/5317023_zNjct/1/324670674_369P3) from Rowan's first year, March 29, 2008 through March 29, 2009. And for those wondering, yes, I continue to take daily pictures though I doubt I will have a picture a day for year 2.
