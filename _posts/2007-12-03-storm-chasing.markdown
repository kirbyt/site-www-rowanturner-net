I am writing this post from Killington.Â  It is snowing like crazy right now and while I sit here by the fire Kirby is out on the slopes.Â  Wish I could join him.Â  We thought we better not waste any time in teaching Baby T about storm chasing.Â  He and I may have to hold off on the actual skiing at this point but being around the snow is a good start!Â  He has been kicking a lot which must mean he is very happy to be here :)
