[![](http://thecave.smugmug.com/photos/406537859_746DD-Th.jpg)](http://thecave.smugmug.com/gallery/6418951_FhYNb//406537859_746DD)Rowan is ready for his first Halloween in Salem. His [costume](http://thecave.smugmug.com/gallery/6418951_FhYNb//406537859_746DD) is very appropriate. The plan today is to carve up a couple of pumpkins, do a little trick or treating (more treating and less tricks this year), then it's off to downtown Salem to join in with the craziness. It will be the best Halloween ever this year.
