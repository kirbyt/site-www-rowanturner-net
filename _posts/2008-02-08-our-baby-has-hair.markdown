I had an utlrasound yesterday.Â  The doctor just wanted to make sure Baby T's growth is still on target since I measure a little small.Â  Everything is fine!!!Â  Anyway, it was hard to get a good look at Baby T since he has grown so big.Â  He is very squished in there.Â  His face was partly turned away and he kept it covered with his hand so we only got a partial view.Â  Something we did see though was his hair.Â  I had no idea that you could see hair on an ultrasound.Â  But as the technician noted, there was his hair "just blowing in the breeze!"Â  We also got to see his heart, a kidney, leg bones and once again...his boy parts.Â  Baby T is due 7 weeks from today!
