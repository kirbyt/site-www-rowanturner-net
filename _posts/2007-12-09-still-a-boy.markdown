There is one thing that Kirby didn't mention in the last posting.Â  We are still having a boy :)Â  This time while looking at Baby TÂ  during the ultra sound I could clearly see his boy parts.Â  The Dr. didn't even have to point them out to me.Â  I really loved watching Baby T move around yesterday...I could watch and feel him kick at the same time.
