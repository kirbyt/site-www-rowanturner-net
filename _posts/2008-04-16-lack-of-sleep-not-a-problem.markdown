A common question asked of us is "Are you getting any sleep?"Â  Or "How are you handling the lack of sleep?" Or "Sleep deprived yet?"Â  Most people are shocked to hear that we are actually getting a good amount of sleep considering we have a new born.Â  Sure, Rowan will wake up during the night to feed but that is to be expected.Â  And he can get a little cranky around 11 PM but that doesn't last long.Â Â  Besides, it's good for a baby to cry a little.Â  Helps give the lungs a need workout.Â  Mama T and I have always gone to bed sometime between midnight and 1 AM so even with the short cranky spell we're still in bed around our normal time.

I think what makes the biggest difference and one of the reasons Mama T and I feel more rested compared to other new parents is our life style.Â  Mama T is not working at the moment and I work from home.Â  This flexibility means we can sleep in a little later if we want.Â  And since both of us are around each day, the other can nap if needed.Â  I'm sure we both would feel more tired if I had to get up early and commute to an office each morning, but lucky for us that is not the case.
