[![](http://photos.thecave.com/Sports/Kayaking-with-Rowan/IMG2721/985467627_rFLVX-Th.jpg)](http://photos.thecave.com/Sports/Kayaking-with-Rowan/13526619_skKsK#985484577_i2tNw)Today I took Rowan out for [his first ride](http://photos.thecave.com/Sports/Kayaking-with-Rowan/13526619_skKsK#985484577_i2tNw) in the new kayak. It was a short ride around Collins Cove. I'm looking forward to longer boat rides with the kid as he become more use to riding in the boat, and I'm more confident he will not stand and flip us.
