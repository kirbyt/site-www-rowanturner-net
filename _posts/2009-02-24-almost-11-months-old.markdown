Rowan is still doing new things everyday though. He has started walking, grown two teeth, and pretty much gotten into everything he can get his hands on. He is getting so old...almost 11 months. I can't believe that in just under 5 weeks from now he will be a year old! Kirby put a few pictures on the gallery the other day so [check them out](http://thecave.smugmug.com/gallery/7400395_Neez3#476782385_AjEuB)!
