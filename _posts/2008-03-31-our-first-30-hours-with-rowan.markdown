Rowan is an absolute joy.Â  We're amazed to have this little man in our lives and there are still moments when it doesn't seem real.Â  The first 30 hours have been quite the adventure.

Rowan was born 10 minutes to midnight.Â  By the time the dust settled it was 6:30 AM and Rowan was the only one in our small family to get some sleep.Â  Mama T was up for 30 hours or so before getting her first 30 minute nap.Â  Rowan did a great job sleeping during the morning and early afternoon despite the traffic of nurses and doctors coming in and out of the room.

Aunt Brooke and Uncle Josh stopped by to visit Rowan during the late afternoon.Â  Rowan enjoyed meeting his relative.Â  He was calm, quiet, and in and out of sleep.Â  But that all changed shortly after the visit.

Mama T and I were finally looking forward to catching a few zzz, but Rowan had different plans. He would eat a little then fall asleep only to wake again a few minutes later.Â  This went on until 5:30 AM this morning at which time we decided it was time for Rowan to visit the nursery.

Mama T was a bit upset about sending off Baby T to the nursery, but she realized the importances of getting some sleep.Â  After all, up to this point Mama T was on less than an hour of sleep.Â  Less than an hour of sleep over nearly 48 hours!Â  I never thought I would see the day when Mama T functions with so little sleep, but she did it.Â  And she did it like a real pro.

The lack of sleep did finally catch up with Rowan as well.Â  Now that just over 30 hours of his new life have past, he is finally sleeping again.Â  With luck, Mama T and I can catch a few extra zzz's as well.
