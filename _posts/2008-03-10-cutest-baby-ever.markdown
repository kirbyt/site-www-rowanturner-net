Click the picture of Baby T to see the [other ultrasound pictures](http://thecave.smugmug.com/gallery/3795609_v77Ds/1/264241862_S52Gm) from today's visit at the doctor's office.

Baby T is doing great. The ultrasound was ordered because Mama T's belly is measuring small. But that's because Baby T's head is way down in Mama T's pelvic area. This is making it difficult for the doctors to accurately measure Baby T.

Later he measured at the 50th percentile. Last week the numbers came back saying he was at the 27th percentile. But that was adjusted and today the doctor said the latest measurements put Baby T at the 89th percentile. But the gut feel is that Baby T is actually around the 50th, maybe 60th, percentile.

Regardless of size Baby T is showing signs of being healthy and active. And Mama T can definitely attest to Baby T being active.
