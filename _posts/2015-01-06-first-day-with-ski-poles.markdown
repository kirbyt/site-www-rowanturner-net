Last weekend Rowan was promoted to "fox" in his ski lesson. This means he is now ready use ski poles starting with his next lesson. Rowan has been very excited about finally getting to use ski poles, but at the same time he was a bit nervous about using them for the first time in his next ski lesson. So today after school we took him up to Spruce so he could get in a few runs...using his new ski poles. And now I see why he was promoted to fox, he had no problems using the poles.
