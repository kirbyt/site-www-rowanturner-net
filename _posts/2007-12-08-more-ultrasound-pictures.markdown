[![](http://thecave.smugmug.com/photos/230076766-Th.jpg)](http://thecave.smugmug.com/gallery/3795609/1/230076766)Mamma T had a surprise ultrasound yesterday. We were not expecting a third ultrasound but apparently the doctors were not happy with some of the pictures from the previous ultrasound. All good for us because we got to see Baby T again. And boy he is growing fast.
