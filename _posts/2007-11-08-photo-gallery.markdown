Did you notice the picture under the heading photo gallery in the right side bar? Click it and it will take you to our new [photo gallery for Baby T](http://thecave.smugmug.com/babyt). We have posted a few pictures already - ultrasound pictures, Melanie and the baby bump - with more coming soon. Also on the [gallery site](http://thecave.smugmug.com/) are other pictures including our recent [trip](http://thecave.smugmug.com/Trips) to Vermont and pictures of the [house](http://thecave.smugmug.com/Our%20House) we hope to buy.
