This evening I spent some time going through some of the clothes that Baby T will wear when he is born. Most were given to us and a few came from some shopping I did in France. Everything is just so cute! And I am sure that seeing the little outfits on Baby T will make them even cuter! Guess that's all I have to say for now.....just feeling excited.
