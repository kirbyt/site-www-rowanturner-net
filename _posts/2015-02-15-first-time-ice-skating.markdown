Rowan's cousin Sedona invited him to go ice skating this morning. Rowan said he didn't want to go because he didn't know how to ice skate and he was scared. I don't blame him. Ice skating and me don't mix either. I showed him a picture of Sedona and Zia ice skating the day before - it was their first time ever yesterday - and that was enough to change his mind.

Rowan had a blast and he got better on each lap around the rink. He even skated briefly without the walker.
