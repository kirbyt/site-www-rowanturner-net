Rowan starts "school" (aka daycare) next week. To prepare I took him to the daycare center for an hour this morning. The idea is to get him familiar with the school before he actually starts next week. But what I learned was the experience was equally as good for me.

During the hour, I got a chance to talk with the teachers. I got to watch the other kids play, and I participated in the couple of activities with Rowan. Before this morning I didn't really know what to expect. I wasn't sure what Rowan's day will be like. But now I have a very good sense of what it will be like for him. I probably got more out of the experience then Rowan did.
