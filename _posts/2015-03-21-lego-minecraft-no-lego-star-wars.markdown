Last weekend Rowan said he wants some Lego Minecraft for his birthday, so I did want any parent with an Amazon account would do. I ordered some Lego Minecraft for him. 

Yesterday Rowan said he wants Lego Star Wars for his birthday. Guess what kid. You're getting Lego Minecraft, and you better damn well like them.
