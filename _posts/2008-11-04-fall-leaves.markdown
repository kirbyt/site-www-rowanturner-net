Our backyard is no exception. I raked the yard over the weekend and we couldn't help ourselves from putting Rowan into the pile of leaves. He wasn't share how to act in the leaf pile but he did look cute. Click [here](http://photos.thecave.com/gallery/6462691_UHahs/1/409921322_CRNGU) for more pictures.
