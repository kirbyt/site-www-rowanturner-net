Who knew that I could wake up 4 or 5 times in one night and still say that I slept well?....or pretty well.Â  That is how I feel today.Â  Sleep has become very difficult for me in the past week.Â  Either Baby T is moving so much that I can't sleep or parts of my body such as my hipsÂ and back are hurting so much that I keep waking up.Â  Oh yeah, let's not forget the fact that I have to go to the bathroom at least 4 times every night.Â  Most people like to remind me that I will only feel more tired after the baby comes.Â  I am just concerned about having enough energy for labor.Â  I keep asking Baby T to please come on a day like today...when I am feeling a bit more rested.Â  I guess he is going to come when he comes though and the excitment of it all will help me along.Â  I really, really can't wait to meet Baby T.
