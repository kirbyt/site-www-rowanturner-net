        <title>Proof Rowan Plays With Lanier Clan Cousins</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Rowan doesn’t see the Lanier Clan often, but when he does he has a blast. Here’s a video I found on my phone from November 14, 2014. It’s a few months old, but it’s still a cute one. And it’s proof Rowan does occasionally play with his cousins from the Lanier side of the family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vimeo-video&quot;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//player.vimeo.com/video/119705354&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>First Time Ice Skating</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Rowan’s cousin Sedona invited him to go ice skating this morning. Rowan said he didn’t want to go because he didn’t know how to ice skate and he was scared. I don’t blame him. Ice skating and me don’t mix either. I showed him a picture of Sedona and Zia ice skating the day before - it was their first time ever yesterday - and that was enough to change his mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rowan had a blast and he got better with each lap around the rink. He even skated briefly without the walker or Josh. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Catamount</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was an exciting day for Rowan. He was prompted to Catamount at snowboard school. That’s the highest level for his age group. I’m very proud of our little shredder. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lost His First Tooth</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After weeks and weeks of having a loose tooth, Rowan finally lost his first tooth today. It fell out while eating a z-bar, which is not surprising since he eats them all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fun In The Wind</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I found this video of the boys playing in the wind two years ago at Camp Murphy 2013, and I just had to post it here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Glades</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Rowan loves riding these wide open glades. He took Mommy T and me through there a couple of times on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Powder And Bumps</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a powder day here in Stowe, so we took to the slopes. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Friday Program</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many things we like about living in Stowe, and one of those things is the public school system. And there are many things we like about the Stowe schools, and one of those things is Friday Program. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday Program is an opportunity for the school kids to enjoy (mostly) winter related activities. On Friday at noon the kids leave their classrooms and head out to do their chosen activity. Each kid picks from the list of activities that include tennis, swimming, ice skating, snowshoeing, cross country skiing, downhill/alpine skiing, telemarking, and snowboarding. Each kid must participate in one activity as it is part of the school curriculum, and the kid cannot change or switch activities during the semester. Also, the kid must have all homework assignments turned in by the day before and must have good grades. Kids who do not meet the requirements have study hall instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the kids pick skiing or snowboarding, but there are some that pick other activities. Some kids that play hockey will pick ice skating, for example. And some kids get enough skiings and snowboarding on the weekends that they prefer doing something else like swimming for Friday Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rowan picked snowboarding for Friday Program this year. This is a great opportunity for him to not only improve his snowboarding skills but to also ride with classmates. Rowan’s group is riding Mansfield this year. Mansfield is the more challenging side of Stowe Mountain Resort. Getting to ride and explore Mansfield in a non-lesson with classmates is definitely going to boost Rowan’s confidence. In fact, we did a few runs yesterday with Rowan after picking him up from Friday Program and his confidence has already improved. He was riding faster and taking trails that he would not do just a couple of weeks ago. And best of all he was having a blast the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to Stowe Elementary School and to the parents who volunteer their time to make Friday Program happen. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Present Farting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I know Christmas 2014 has come and gone, but I just had to share this. Santa brought Rowan a fart gun for Christmas. The thing just cracks him and me up. And so does this video from Christmas morning. Rowan shot each and every present with a fart ray after he opened the fart gun present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vimeo-video&quot;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//player.vimeo.com/video/115498546&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>First Day With Ski Poles</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend Rowan was promoted to “fox” in his ski lesson. This means he is now ready use ski poles starting with his next lesson. Rowan has been very excited about finally getting to use ski poles, but at the same time he was a bit nervous about using them for the first time in his next ski lesson. So today after school we took him up to Spruce so he could get in a few runs…using his new ski poles. And now I see why he was promoted to fox, he had no problems using the poles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vimeo-video&quot;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//player.vimeo.com/video/116114170&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
